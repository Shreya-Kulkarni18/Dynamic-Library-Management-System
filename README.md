# Dynamic-Library-Management-System
The Library Management System is a Java-based console application that streamlines the management of books within a library by allowing users to add, borrow, and return books organized by genre. Users can explore available books in specific genres, borrow titles, and track their own borrowed items, creating a personalized library experience. The system uses object-oriented principles to separate concerns, with the LibrarySystem handling all book operations and the Book class managing book-specific data like title, author, and availability status. By utilizing efficient data structures like Map for genre organization, Set for available books, and List for user-specific borrowed books, this project provides a robust solution for small-scale library management, showcasing the essentials of data encapsulation, structure, and modular design in Java.
